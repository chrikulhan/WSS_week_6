// Maps with Leaftlet.Js:

// Link to Leafletâ€™s CSS and JS
// Create a div (will be empty on the page) to contain the map,
// and set the size to have non-zero height and width
// Use JS to configure and customize the map (center of map, how zoomed in, etc.)

// https://leafletjs.com/

//googlemaps.com is a famous mapping library, there is less set up for leaflet.
