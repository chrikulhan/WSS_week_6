<!--type canvas element (below) in body of html-->
<!--give it an id
a height and a width
can be empty, no content necessary.-->
<!--<canvas id ="canvas" height = "200" width = "300">-->
<!--  change size a little:-->
<canvas id ="canvas" height = "500" width = "500">
<!--  ^^make the size bigger-->
</canvas>

<!--add script, after you canvas in your body:-->

<script>
<!--  create a variable to represent the canvas:-->
  let canvas = document.querySelector('#canvas')
//create a context (called a drawing contex), the thing that will
// actually do the drawing on the canvas:
  let context = canvas.getContext('2d')
//to draw something, you ask the context to draw whatever you need.
//an easy thing to draw is a rectangle or square:
//  context.fillRect(20, 20, 100, 100)
//20 pixels from the left,20 pixels from the top is where on the page it starts
//100 pixels wide,100 pixels tall is how big it is.
//default color is black.
context.fillRect(120, 20, 50, 200)
//^^moved the rectangle to the right a little (120).
//^^changed the size to 50, 200 results in a tall narrow rectangle.
