<!--Topic 6- Lab – Javascript Libraries-->
<!--For this lab, and every lab, add comments to your code to explain the new concepts,
complex code, and anything that's not obvious from just reading the code.-->

<!--Part 1: Drawing Program. (6 points) Start with the mouse drag program in the example repository.
Add the following features:-->
<!--•	Draw a circle instead of a square. The circle's center should be centered over the mouse pointer.-->
<!--•	Add an input type="color" to select the drawing color.  The value from a color input can be used
with a context.strokeStyle or context.fillStyle statement-->
<!--•	Add an input type="range" to set the radius of the circles drawn-->
<!--When the user draws circles, the circles should be the color selected in the color input, and the size
of the circles should be the size selected in the radius input.-->
<!--(Optional: Extra credit available for best drawing drawn with your program. Also optional extra credit
for adding extra drawing tools to your page.)-->

<!--Part 2: Longest US Bridges Map. (7 points) Use the dataset below to draw a Leaflet map showing a marker
for each of the five bridges with the longest spans in the USA.-->
<!--Put all the data into an array of objects, and then loop over that array to create the markers and popups.
Don't create five individual markers in your code.-->
<!--Your map should have an appropriate size, center location, and zoom level, to clearly show all five bridges.
Place a marker at each bridge location. Each marker should have a popup with the bridge's name and span length.
Use HTML to format this information neatly.-->

<!--Part 2a (Optional for extra credit +3 points)-->
<!--•	Instead of the default marker, draw a bridge icon at the locations. You'll find an example at
Leaflet's website. Example icon: https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/bridge_183412.-->
<!--•	Examine your bridge data array and use JavaScript to figure out which bridge is longest.
Draw the marker for this bridge in a different color, or display a different icon for the longest bridge.
You can change the colors of an icon if you register for a Flaticon account.-->

<!--Part 3: Longest US Bridges Chart. (5 points) Use the dataset below to draw a Chart.js bar chart
of the bridge names and their span lengths.  You can draw the chart on the same page as the map, or
you can make a new page.-->
<!--Use the array you created in part 2 to avoid typing the data into your program again.  Don't manually
write the data into Chart.js arrays. -->
